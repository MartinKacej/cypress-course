## My Cypress course code
Small testing project used to learn Cypress basics.

Some tests are using [DEMOQA](https://demoqa.com) web for practicing automation.

Tests in [real_app](/cypress/e2e/real_app) directory needs [Cypress Realword App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app), sample testing application to be active on port 3000.
